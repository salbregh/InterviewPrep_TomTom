### Technical Interview TomTom
This repo is for the technical interview simulation organized by Codam, assignment by TomTom. The assignment is based on applying for a full stack developer position. 

### Assignment
The assignment is creating a simple version of the game wordle. In the console it will print information on the correctness of your word. It will show you when a letter is correct, if the letter is at the correct position and if a letter is not in the word.

### Error Checking
- The word must be 5 letters.
- The word must be in the word list.
- Qapital letters will be accepted as input.
- The program only accepts alphabetical characters.

### Run Project
To run the application in the browser, execute the following command: `bash run_wordle.sh`. This will open up localhost:3000 in a browser with the game wordle. Right click on the browser and go to inspect, and then to the console to see the output of the program.
